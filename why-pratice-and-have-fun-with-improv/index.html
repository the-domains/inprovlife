There was no actual rotine plan followed there, right? Well, unless you were born by caesarean operation I guess. But even my birth by caesarean operation was Improv! I had my umbilical cord around my neck! (supposedly the major “motive” to perform that operation) So, they went “around” to solve that. Yes, you have some natural steps that will happen in a birth. And every birth is a different experience to the one’s experiencing it. So it’s what you experience in improv.</p><p>My point is: when “things happen”, life is improvisation. Yes, with all the information, experience, background, conditionating and patterns you have at a specific moment. These were already there, within. That will be also from where, or with what you improvise and act in this world. Because <strong>life doesn’t happen in your cognitive plans and rationalizing thoughts</strong>.</p><p>Life happens now, in the moment. Where and when you decide to (and how to) “cut the umbilical cord”. When you choose what you will do first from your to do list. Especially when you’re not feeling like doing the first task you wrote down in your checklist!), or when… something comes out of the blue and jumps in front of what you were supposed to do.</p><p>As widely defined, improvisation is “a state of being and creating action without pre-planning (…) or reacting in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one’s immediate environment and inner feelings”.[1] <strong>Have you ever been in a situation where you were not responding to external or internal stimuli</strong>? You cannot honestly answer yes to this, right? No matter what plan or previous idea you had before.</p><p>This doesn’t mean and is different from having a previous intent to what you want to see materialized. After being born, the baby grows with several intentions being manifested all the time, right? The hunger, the thirst, the longing for touch and love, the call for attention, the curiosity, the need to understand and being understood. Those <strong>inner intentions</strong>, if you will, <strong>are guiding one’s action</strong>without having a plan behind it. Or you imagine a baby planning how to “bring the house down from the top of my lungs until they give me what I want!”? If you’re thinking about someone you know or heard about… well… do you imagine that person pre-planning every single action? It’s insane!! One would not had time to share, to achieve, to live!</p><p>When you connect with that «baby improv state», way of interacting with the world, you play the game of acceptance. For one, <strong>you do not know what will happen in the future</strong>. Despite when you grow old you may have gained the illusion you do, but you really don’t. So, you say “Yes, and…” to whatever happens. For two, as far as we can tell, you wouldn’t have ideas like “the world should be like ….”. So, <strong>you accept unconditionally what it is</strong>. For it can never be different now from what it is. At most, is information, stimuli, to be processed and dealt with.</p><p>Imagine: “Oh. I’m here, inside feeling like I want to move over there to that shinny noisy funny thing and I don’t know to do that «legs thing» those giants call walking. What should I do? Why doesn’t that thing come to me? I’ve no luck…”. Is that how you see the baby acting? No, right? The baby will <strong>improvise</strong>, will try, will move, will crawl, will walk and stumble, will cry, yell, <strong>will do whatever feels it will provide one’s intention in response to the given stimuli and circumstances – untold and unforeseen</strong>.</p><p>Improvisation, from latin in-“not” + provisus-“foreseen”, is all about that.[2] Dealing with, responding to, (inter)acting upon the unforeseen. <strong>Do you know</strong>anything more unforeseen than everyday life? Than how to sell to a new customer? Than how to lead an organization to success? Than unrevealing how to heal a deep wound? Than how to run a team meeting? Than how to solve a problem? Than how to positively respond and solve a conflit in a discussion?</p><p>In my life and professional experience, I’ve observed that the vast majority of <strong>humans spend their life in a state of being and performing, many times, without being aware about what and how they are doing and performing</strong>. Either in their work, in their social life, with their spouse, with their children. And it’s all ok. As long as the person is ok with the way that she thinks and feels about that. Tricky? Maybe, maybe not. Let’s see.</p><p>I want to finish this article sharing with you <strong>three things you can learn and gain with improve practice and improv based training:</strong></p><p>I. One of the major learnings one can have is becoming more aware of how one thinks, feels, acts, responds. For example, dealing with the (so called) “failure”, the disappointment, the stress, the perfectionism, the self-confidence, the frustration, the successes, the self-esteem one has. And that makes a huge difference when you want to improve your life results.</p><p>2∞ Other major learning will be about discovering more possibilities, ways of acting, solving, dealing with something – especially in those situations when one meets a “roadblock”, “one way entry-exit roundabout” or a “dead end”. Improv improves creativity, communication, problem solving, flexibility, dealing with the need of “being right”, the so called soft skills.</p><p>3-) Another major learning and gain is that you get to live and experience more of your life and the results you achieve. Particularly, without so much of the social masks or conditionated ways that limit your expression, success and being.</p><p>So, here’s my invitation to you:</p><p>Live! Improv! And improve your Life.</p><p>[1]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation</a></p><p>[2]<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/improvisation">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/improvisation</a></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">Why pratice (and have fun with) Improv?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
